1. meaning of HSVColor


HSVColor is a class in Flutter that represents a color using the HSV color model, which stands for:

H — Hue (the type of color, measured in degrees from 0° to 360°; e.g., 0° = red, 120° = green, 240° = blue)

S — Saturation (how vivid or “pure” the color is; ranges from 0.0 to 1.0; 0 = gray, 1 = fully saturated)

V — Value (brightness; ranges from 0.0 to 1.0; 0 = black, 1 = full brightness)

Why use HSV instead of RGB

RGB (Red, Green, Blue) is great for defining exact colors, but if you want many distinct colors dynamically, HSV is easier because you can:

Vary hue to get completely different colors.

Keep saturation and value consistent so all colors look balanced.

Cycle through hues to generate unique colors for lists of items (like projects) automatically.
