Recommended Approach for You

Since your app seems to be device-based (no login), here’s what’s best for your current setup:

✅ Short term (easy):

Auto-create user record in backend if none exists for that UUID (so reinstalls always work).

✅ Long term (better):

Replace your randomly generated UUID with a stable ID from device_info_plus.
That way, even if the user deletes and reinstalls the app, the same ID will be generated again, and their data will reappear.
